# seurat2

Refined `seurat` package (https://github.com/satijalab/seurat) with following
purposes:

- improves codes readability by following [Hadley
  style](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).
- improves running speed by using vectorization as much as possible.
- incorporate new schemes/algorithms to improve performance.

**Hopefully it will be merged into `seurat` package**.
